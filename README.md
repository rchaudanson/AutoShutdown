AutoShutdown is a small application that allows a user's computer to be shut down at a predefined time.<br><br>
Easily from the interface, the user can cancel the scheduled shutdown of his computer at any time for the current day, the automatic shutdown is reactivated the next day.<br><br>
The goal is to turn off unused computers that have not been turned off by users.
